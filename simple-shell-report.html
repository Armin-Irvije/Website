            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                SShell is a shell program in C that runs basic command line executions and 
                handling. The program's functionality involves reading user commands 
                followed by tokenizing and parsing through the <code>tokenize()</code> function.
                The individual tokens are processed by the <code>tokenHandler</code> state machine, which 
                adds tokens based on the current state. The program will start in the 
                <code>CMD_STATE</code> and transitions to flag or args states as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the initial tokenization, the control moves to <code>command.c</code>, where an instance of the 
                command struct is created. The program checks for flags, 
                arguments, redirection, or piping. Flags are tallied, and arguments are stored.
                Once the command struct is populated, the program iterates through a linked 
                list, invoking <code>assert()</code> that leads to a <code>fork()</code>. In the child process, 
                checks for redirection, piping, or appending are performed, followed by the 
                execution of built-in functions and <code>execvp()</code>. Child process finishes 
                and exit back to parent process.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                The program has a modular design, with the main functionality distributed 
                between <code>sshell.c</code>, handling user input, and <code>command.c</code>, containing functions 
                related to command execution. <code>sshell.c</code> handles user input, tokenizes input, 
                manages pipes and redirection. This modular approach enhances readability and 
                supports scalability making it easier with future extensions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>command.c</code> defines the structure <code>Command</code> and <code>CommandNode</code> to represent commands and 
                linked list. We also implement command-related functions such as <code>execute()</code>, 
                <code>buildCommand()</code>, and <code>createCommand()</code>. Functions are organized based on their 
                responsibilities. The programs design demonstrates thought of organization of 
                code with the use of structures, linked lists and state machines which all 
                contributes to a well structed codebase.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Tokenization</h2>
            <p>
                The <code>tokenize()</code> function divides the input command into tokens using whitespace 
                as a delimiter. The state machine in <code>tokenHandler</code> processes these tokens, 
                constructing the command structure. The <code>CMD_STATE</code> creates a new command and 
                tranisitions to <code>ARG_STATE</code>. Inside the arg state we determine the type of token 
                (flag, redirection, append, or argument).
            </p>
            <p>
                If we encounter <code>></code>, <code>>></code>, and <code>|</code> we 
                change to <code>REDIR_STATE</code>, <code>APP_STATE</code>, <code>PIPE_STATE</code> respectively. A state 
                machine was chosen to organize specific actions within each state. Its 
                adaptability to diverse inputs is what made it very useful for the program.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Command Structure</h2>
            <p>
                A <code>Command</code> struct stores command name, flags, arguments, and indications of 
                redirection or piping. Arrays were used for handling multiple flags and 
                arguments. The decision to use a struct stems from the need to instantiate 
                an object with all relevant variables. These structs are stored in a linked 
                list (<code>CommandNode</code>), enabling the handling of an arbitrary number of pipelines. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Linked list were used for the benefits of dynamic memory management and its 
                ability to handle a variable number of commands without the need use a fixed 
                size array. The <code>assert()</code> function is responsible for forking processes into 
                parent and child. Pattern matching identifies built-in the commands otherwise 
                <code>execvp()</code> is utilized. Commands access a <code>Command</code> struct node to 
                retrieve arguments.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Built-in Commands</h2>
            <p>
                The <code>cd</code> function changes the directory by checking for the necessary arguments
                and using <code>chdir()</code>. For <code>pwd</code>, the C function <code>getcwd</code> retrieves the working 
                directory, which is then printed to <code>stdout</code>. <code>sls</code> prints information on the 
                directory and its files using <code>opendir()</code>, <code>readdir()</code>, and <code>stat</code> for file 
                details.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Output Redirection</h2>
            <p>
                The process for output redirection and appending allow the user to redirect the
                standard out put to a file or append it. This is achieved through <code>REDIR_STATE</code>
                and <code>APP_STATE</code> which checks if the token and determines if we need to open an 
                existing file or create a new one. <code>fdRedir</code> is the file descriptor that is 
                connected to the opening of the file. This variable is used to redirect the 
                standard output to the specfiied file.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Piping</h2>
            <p>
                Logic for piping is separated into distinct functions, enhancing code 
                readability. <code>pipeHandler()</code> is a the function responsible for 
                managing the piping logic. The function switches between states 
                (<code>PIPE_BEGIN</code>, <code>PIPE</code>, <code>PIPE_END</code>) that determine the begining middle and end 
                of the piping process.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>PIPE_BEGIN</code> connects the standard output of the current
                command to the write end of the new pipe. This allows the command's output to 
                be fed into the pipe. <code>PIPE</code> connects standard output to the write end of the new 
                pipe, which facilitates the flow of data between commands in the pipe. In each 
                of the cases we use <code>dup2</code> to duplicate file descriptors connecting input 
                and out to the appropriate part of the pipe.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>fileDesc</code> is the two-d array used to store file descriptors connected to the pipes. 
                The array keeps track of read and write ends of the pipes. The piping process enables output of 
                one process to serve as the input of another improving functionality of the shell.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Testing & Debugging Strategy</h2>
            <p>
                A <code>printVerbose</code> variable controls print statements throughout the code, aiding
                in tracking the command execution process during testing. These statements 
                proved crucial for debugging, providing a clear look into program flow. In the 
                <code>tester.sh</code> file, additional <code>echo</code> statements were incorporated to display 
                the expected <code>stdout</code> of the tester, facilitating debugging efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also took time to create more test cases that checked error management and edges case that
                were not test in the initial tester file. The error management was conducted by
                our <code>checkParseError</code>. This function checks parsing errors like missing commands
                and improper metacharacters and absence of output file when piping. The errors 
                are reported to <code>stderr</code>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The SShell program is a well designed simple version of a bash shell
                that effectively handles basic command line executions and various features 
                such as tokenization, command struct representation, built-in commands, output 
                redirection, and piping. The modular design, with distinct responsibilities 
                assigned to different parts of the code, contributes to readability, 
                maintainability, and scalability.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tokenization process efficiently processes user input and constructs the command structure. 
                The use of a state machine facilitates adaptability to diverse inputs. The command structure 
                provides a flexible way to handle an arbitrary number of pipelines. The separation of 
                logic into <code>main.c</code> and <code>command.c</code> enhances code organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                The testing and debugging strategy, including the use of a <code>printVerbose</code> variable and 
                additional <code>echo</code> statements in the test script, illustrates a thoughtful 
                approach to identifying and addressing issues. The creation of expanded 
                test cases, including those for error management and edge cases,
                ensured the robustness of the program.
            </p>
            <p>
                The SSHELL program showcases an efficient approach to building a shell in C, providing a solid
                foundation for potential further development and extension.
